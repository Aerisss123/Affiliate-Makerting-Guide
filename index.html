            <h2>What is Affiliate Marketing?</h2>
            <p>Affiliate marketing is one of the most popular and profitable ways to earn passive income online. It involves promoting other companies' products or services and earning a commission for each sale made through your unique referral link. This model works because businesses need customers, and affiliates help them drive sales by leveraging their online presence.</p>

            <p>The beauty of affiliate marketing is that it allows you to earn money without creating your own product. Instead, you act as a middleman between the buyer and the seller. Whether you're blogging, posting on social media, or making YouTube videos, affiliate marketing gives you an opportunity to monetize your audience.</p>
